             This program is really only intended for the BTC Challenge. However, you can use it to generate your own personal BTC address and use it.
             It is a spinoff of JLP's original VanitySearch.
             Program supports a simple -bits flag and Begin and End Range (-begr and -endr) flags. New version also supports full address with newer RTX cards.
             It has been tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11 on RTX 30xx cards, RTX 20xx cards and a GTX 1660 Ti card.

             This version is still a beta version, there are a lot of things that can be fail or improve. 
             This version also could have some bugs. please report it.
             Modes
             Keyhunt can work in different ways at different speeds.
             The current available modes are:
             address
             rmd160
             xpoint
             bsgs
             Experimental modes
             minikeys
             pub2rmd
             address mode
             This is the most basic approach to work, in this mode your text file need to have a list of the public address to be search.
             Example of address from solved puzzles, this file is already on the repository tests/1to32.txt

             ...
             To target that file we need to execute keyhunt with this line
             ./keyhunt -m address -f tests/1to32.txt -r 1:FFFFFFFF'''
